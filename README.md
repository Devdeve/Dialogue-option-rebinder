# Dialogue Option Rebinder
This is a plugin that will allow you to rebind your dialog options with NPC's to different keybinds from the original 1-6

# Thanks
Big thank you to [JZomDev](https://github.com/JZomDev) and his [Construction QOL plugin](https://github.com/JZomDev/zom-external-plugins) for the help with fixing and
making the plugin work.

I would've never figured some of this out on my own.
